Change Log
=======

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

Starting from v4.0.0, this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

# [unreleased]

# [v8.0.0rc2] 2024-04-22

## Fixed

- TCP client implementation re-worked to be thread-safe. Also added more graceful shut-down
  handling. Consequently, the thread spawned by the TCP client is not daemonic anymore.

## Changed

- Replaced `TelemetryListT` by `List[bytes]`.
- Renamed `TcpSpacePacketsComIF` to `TcpSpacePacketsClient`.
- Renamed `UdpComIF` to `UdpClient`.

# [v8.0.0rc1] 2024-01-24

## Fixed

- Fixed bug for acknowledged file transfer cancellation in the destination handler.

## Removed

- The `tmtccmd.util.countdown` and `tmtccmd.util.seqcnt` module were moved to the `spacepackets`
  library.
- Most of the `tmtccmd.cfdp` module was moved to the
  [`cfdp-py` library](https://github.com/us-irs/cfdp-py).

# [v8.0.0rc0] 2023-11-29

## Added

- Added new command tree mechanism which allows to specify the telecommand structure in a more
  flexible way. This mechanism deprecated the old service/op code combination. The user can now
  specify the whole command structure as a tree, and specify commands as a slash separated path
  through that tree.

## Removed

- Removed high level CFDP handler and CFDP in CCSDS handler which are not generic enough
  and do not work in their current form. These handlers might be re-added with a proper
  implementation which also allow building a CFDP daemon / full CFDP entity more easily.

## Changed

- Move `tmtccmd.tmtc.base` to `tmtccmd.tmtc.tm_base` and deprecate it.

# [v7.0.0] 2023-11-10

## Added

- The CFDP source and destination handler can now also handle cancel requests.
- The CFDP source handler can handle acknowleded mode transfers now.
- New `from_seconds` classmethod for `Countdown` class.

## Changed

- All CFDP exceptions are now exposed via the `tmtccmd.cfdp.exceptions` module.
- Both CFDP source destination handler now expect a `RemoteEntityCfgTable` for remote configuration
  setup.
- CFDP source and dest handler now both have the `entity_id` property to retrieve the local ID.
- CFDP handler transmission mode and CFDP state are separate from each other now. The
  transmission mode can be retrieved using a new `transmission_mode` property for both handlers,
  and the `CfdpState` `BUSY_CLASS_2_ACKED` and `BUSY_CLASS_1_NACKED` variants were merged into a
  `BUSY` variant.
- Setting a sequnce of space packet IDs for TCP space packet parsing is now mandatory
  for the TCP communication interface. This avoids confusing errors during run-time.
- Removed some global usage for the TCP communication interface
- The CFDP source and destination handlers can now only handle one packet at a time. This makes
  reasoning about the logic of those handlers, and subsequently extending and adapting them
  a lot easier. Multiple packets can still be inserted by calling the `insert_packet` and
  `state_machine` function consecutively.
- Moved all `pus_*` modules located inside the `tm` and `tc` module to the new`pus/tm` `pus/tc`
  submodule.
- Renamed all `pus_*` modules to `s_*` modules (service)
- Renamed `funccmd` PUS modules to `action`.
- Unified `tc` and `tm` module into `tmtc` module. All `tmtccmd.tm` and `tmtccmd.tc` imports
  needs to be replaced with `tmtccmd.tmtc`.
- The `CheckLimitProvider` abstraction must now be explicitely passed to the CFDP entity instead
  of being passed via the remote configuration.
- `Countdown` class `timeout` property now returns a `timedelta` object to avoid inconsistency
  of getter and setter property. There is a new `timeout_ms` property to returns the timeout
  as milliseconds.

## Removed

- Removed `serial_fixed_frame` module and `SerialFixedFrameComIF` class which has been
  deprecated since v4.0.0a0.
- `SerialCommunicationType`: Removed `FIXED_FRAME_BASED` variant.
- Hardcoded AT91 paths in `QEMUComIF`.
- Removed deprecated TM modules.

## Fixed

- Various fixes for the `QEMUComIF`.
- Fixed the check timer and check limit mechanism for CFDP. The `RemoteEntityCfg` not only
  expects a `check_limit` integer field which defaults to 2.

# [v6.0.0] 2023-09-14

- Changed package license from Apache-2.0 to dual Apache-2.0 or MIT.
- spacepackets version v18.0.0

## Fixed

- Bugfix for destination handler: Clear out file data queue when handling it.

## Changed

- TCP communication interface:
  - Frame limit is optional now.
  - Small change to allow handling more than 4096 bytes in one polling cycle.
- Renamed `args_to_params_tmtc` to `args_to_all_params_tmtc` and `args_to_params_cfdp` to
  `args_to_all_params_cfdp`
- `PutRequest` model now stores both destination and source file path as a Python `Path`.

## Added

- Added new `cfdp_args_to_cfdp_params` function which only performs the conversion of CFDP
  argparse arguments to the internalized `CfdpParams` type.
- Explicit functions to convert internalized CFDP parameters to a put request:
  1. `cfdp_req_to_put_req_get_req`
  2. `cfdp_req_to_put_req_proxy_put_req`
  3. `cfdp_req_to_put_req_regular`
- Generic `generic_cfdp_params_to_put_request` conversion function which converts the
  internalized CFDP parameters to a put request based on heuristics.

# [v6.0.0rc0] 2023-09-04

- Bumped `spacepackets` to v0.18.0rc1

## Added

- The `CfdpParams` config wrapper now has an additional `proxy_op` field.
- New `cfdp_req_to_put_req_regular` and `cfdp_req_to_put_req_proxy_get_req` API to convert standard
  `CfdpParams` instances to `PutRequest`s
- The CFPD source handler is now able to convert PutRequest metadata fields to options. It is also
  able to request metadata only PDUs now, allowing it to perform proxy operations.

## Changed

- Adapted the FSFW specific Housekeeping service API to make HK requests diagnostic agnostic.
  The PUS interface has proven to be cumbersome and problematic, so the split between diagnostic
  and regular HK packets has been removed in newer version of the FSFW. The new API reflects that.
  The old API is still available by using the `*_with_diag` suffix.
- The former `PutRequestCfg` dataclass is now named `PutRequest`. The former `PutRequest` class
  is now named `PutRequestCfgWrapper` and simply wraps a `CfdpParams` dataclass.
- The CFDP source handler expects the `PutRequest` dataclass instead of a CFDP request wrapper now
  for the `put_request` API.

## Removed

- The CFDP source handler `start_cfdp_transaction` API was removed. It was only able to process
  put requests in its current form anyway. The `put_request` method is sufficient for now.
- Package version is single-sourced using the `importlib.metadata` variant: The `pyproject.toml`
  now contains the version information, but the informatio can be retrieved at runtime
  by using the new `version.get_version` API or `importlib.metadata.version("spacepackets")`.
- `setup.py` which is not required anymore.

# [v5.0.0] 2023-07-13

## Changed

- `add_def_proc_and_cfdp_as_subparsers` returns the subparsers now.

# [v5.0.0rc0] 2023-06-09

`spacepackets` version: v0.17.0

## Changed

- Moved `tmtccmd.util.tmtc_printer` module to `tmtccmd.fsfw.tmtc_printer`. Old module references
  new module, old module marked deprecated.
- The `FsfwTmtcPrinter` `get_validity_buffer` function is a `staticmethod` now.

## Fixed

- Bump of `spacepackets`: Bugfix in spacepacket parser which lead to broken packets in the TCP
  communication interface.

# [v5.0.0a0] 2023-05-14

`spacepackets` version: v0.16.0

## Fixed

- Bumped `spacepackets` to v0.16.0 for important bugfix in PDU header format.

## Added

- Added FSFW parameter service API to dump parameters.
- Added FSFW parameter service `FsfwParamId` class to uniquely identify a parameter in a
  FSFW context.

## Changed

- The FSFW parameter service helper class `Parameter` is now a composition of the raw parameter data
  and the new `FsfwParamId` class.
- The `create_load_param_cmd` API now expects a `Paramter` instead of raw data.

# [v4.1.3] 2023-06-19

## Fixed

- Dependency specifier for `spacepackets`, dependency specifier for pre v1.0 versions in general.

# [v4.1.2] 2023-03-18

## Fixed

- `logging` usage for GUI.

# [v4.1.1] 2023-02-23

## Changed

- Improvements for documentation: Added `spacepackets` cross-references.

# [v4.1.0] 2023-02-23

## Added

- Added various parameter helpers in the `pus.s20_fsfw_param` module. This includes
  helper methods to pack signed values (i8, i16 and i32), float/double vectors and matrices
  parameters.

# [v4.0.0] 2023-02-17

Starting from this version, the project will adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https:://semver.org/).
spacepackets version: v0.15.0

## Changed

- Renamed `pus.s5_event` and `pus.s5_event_defs` to `pus.s5_fsfw_event` and
  `pus.s5_fsfw_event_defs` to better reflect this module is FSFW specific.

## Added

- First sat-rs support modules: `pus.s5_satrs_event` and `pus.s5_satrs_event_defs`

## Removed

- `pack_generic_service_5_test_into` removed, not generic enough.

# [v4.0.0rc2] 2023-02-12

## Fixed

- Use custom package discovery in `pyproject.toml` similarly how to discovery
  was handled in `setup.cfg`. Auto-Discovery was problematic, package is not discovered
  correctly.

# [v4.0.0rc1] 2023-02-10

`spacepackets` version 0.14.0

## Fixed

- `config.args`: Assigning of the COM interface in the args to setup converters is now done in
  the `args_to_params_generic` function. Otherwise, this feature does not work for the conversion
  of CFDP arguments.

## Changed

- Remove `setup.cfg` and move to `pyproject.toml`. Create new `.flake8` file accordingly.

## Added

- `tc.pus_200_fsfw_mode.create_announce_mode_command` added.

# [v4.0.0rc0] 2023-02-03

- `spacepackets` version 0.14.0rc3

## Changed

### Logging

The usage of the `logging` library now is a lot more pythonic and more
aligned to the recommended way to use the logger. The `get_console_logger` has become deprecated.
Users are encouraged to create custom application loggers using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
It is also possible to apply the library log format to an application logger using
`tmtccmd.logging.add_colorlog_console_logger`.

- Mark `get_console_logger` as deprecated.
- New `tmtccmd.init_logger` method to set up library logger.
- The logging default init function does not set up an error file logger anymore.
- (breaking) Rename `set_up_colorlog_logger` to `add_colorlog_console_logger`.

## Added

- New `add_error_file_logger` function.

# [v4.0.0a3] 2023-01-31

- `spacepackets` version 0.14.0rc2

## Added

- `tmtccmd.com.ComInterface`: Added two new generic exceptions:
  - `ReceptionDecodeError` for generic decoder errors on packet reception.
  - `SendError` for generic send errors when sending packets.
- `tmtccmd.pus.pus_20_fsfw_params_defs`: New `ParameterId` and `Parameter` helper
  dataclasses. Also added `Service20ParamDumpWrapper` helper class
  to help with the deserialization of parameters. The helper classes can be used both
  for TC and TM handling. Create new API set to create the `Parameter` classes for common
  parameter types.
- `SetupParams` can now already include a COM interface instance.
- CLI arguments: Added the `--pp` or `--prompt-proc` argument which only has meaning when used
  together with the listener flag (`-l`). It should cause the main application to prompt for
  a procedure (but still go to listener mode after the procedure).

## Changed

### Argument parsing and Core modules

- (breaking): `tmtccmd.config.hook.TmTcCfgHookBase` renamed to `tmtccmd.config.hook.HookBase`.
- (breaking): The `PostArgsParsingWrapper` constructor now expects a `SetupParams` parameter and
  caches it.
  All `set_*` methods now do not expect the `SetupParams` to be passed explicitely anymore.
- (breaking): The `PreArgsParsingWrapper` now expects a `setup_params` parameter to be passed to the
  `parse` method. The parameter helper will be cached in the created `PostArgsParsingWrapper`.
- `args_to_params_tmtc` now expects an `assign_com_if` method and can assign a COM interface
  when it is passed. It oftentimes makes sense to determine a valid COM interface
  (and prompt applicable parameters from the user) before prompting procedure parameters.
  The new behaviour is the default when using the `PostArgsParsingWrapper`.

### PUS modules

- (breaking): Renamed `tmtccmd.*.*20_params.py` to
  `tmtccmd.*.*20_fsfw_param.py` to reflect these modules are tailored
  towards usage with the FSFW.
- (breaking): Reworked `tmtccmd.tm.pus_20_fsfw_params` by simplifying `Service20FsfwTm`
  significantly. It only implements `AbstractPusTm` now and is a simple wrapper
  around `PusTelemetry`, which is exposed as a `pus_tm` member.
- (breaking): Renamed `tm.pus_5_event` to `tm.pus_5_fsfw_event` to better reflect these modules
  are tailored towards usage with the FSFW
- (breaking): Simplified `Service5Tm` significantly. It only implements `AbstractPusTm` now and
  is a more simple wrapper around `PusTelemetry` exposing some FSFW specific functionality.
- (breaking): Renamed `tmtccmd.*.*200_fsfw_modes` to `tmtccmd.*.*200_fsfw_mode` and
  `tmtccmd.*.*20_fsfw_params` to `tmtccmd.*.*20_fsfw_param` for consistency.
- `tmtccmd.tc.pus_20_params.py`: Create new `crate_fsfw_load_param_cmd` and
  deprecate the former `pack_fsfw_load_param_cmd` function.

### Other

- (breaking): `DefaultPusQueueHelper`: `seq_cnt_provider`, `pus_verificator`
  and `default_pus_apid` (formerly `pus_apid`) do not have default values anymore
  and need to be specified explicitely.
- (breaking): Renamed `tmtccmd.config.com.ComIfCfgBase` to `ComCfgBase`
- (breaking): `tmtccmd.com.ComInterface`: Change `get_id` to `id` property.
- (breaking): TCP (`tmtccmd.com.TcpSpacePacketsComIF`) and `tmtccmd.com.UdpComIF`:
   Remove `max_recv_size` argument and replace it with 4096 where it was used.
- (breaking): TCP: Renamed `tmtccmd.com.TcpComIF` to `tmtccmd.com.TcpSpacePacketsComIF` to better
  reflect this interface sends and expects space packets.
- (breaking) TCP: The TCP communication interface now expects a generic `Sequence[PacketId]`
  instead of a tuple of raw packet IDs. This makes usage more ergonomic.
- (possibly breaking): Rename `com_if` module to `com`.
- (breaking): `tmtccmd.tc.queue.DefaultPusQueueHelper`: The timestamp length of time tagged
  telecommands needs to be specified explicitely now (no default value of 4).

## Fixed

- TCP: Actually use the TM polling frequency parameter now in the TM reception thread.
- TCP: The `data_available` API now works properly by always converting the internal unparsed
  TM queue to the TM packet list and returning its length.

# [v4.0.0a2] 2023-01-23

## Added

- Added `apid` and `seq_count` optional arguments back to generic
  (not FSFW specific) TC constructors.
- Cleaned up telecommand and telemetry code, removed a lot of obsolete
  functionality

## Changed

- (breaking) `pus` module: Renamed `pus_?...` modules to `s?_...`. These modules
  now re-export all their definitions and everything in their similarly
  named `tm` and `tc` modules.
- (breaking) `pus.pus_8_funccmd`: Renamed `Subservices` to `CustomSubservice`
- TC creation API: Replace `generate_...` API with `create_...` API for consistency
- (breaking) Renamed `Subservices` to `Subservice`, use singular enum because they are not
  flag enums.
- (breaking) `pus_200_fsfw_mode`: Rename `Modes` to `Mode`.
- Subservice enumerations: Add missing `TM_...` and `TC_...` prefixes where applicable
- Use concrete `spacepackets` version 0.14.0rc1

# [v4.0.0a1] 2023-01-12

# [v4.0.0a0] 2023-01-05

## Added

- New `SerialCobsComIF` communication interface to send and received COBS encoded packets.

## Changes

- `CoreComInterfaces`: Renamed `ser_*` interface names to `serial_*`.

  - `SerialFixedFrameComIF`, but this one has also been deprecated now.
  - `SerialDleComIF` for sending and receiving DLE encoded packets.
- Switched to compatible release requirement for dependencies.
- `ComInterface`: Added new abstract method `get_id`, removed `__init__` dunder.

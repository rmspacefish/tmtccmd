# [unreleased]

# [v5.0.0rc0] 2023-06-09

`spacepackets` version: v0.17.0

## Changed

- Moved `tmtccmd.util.tmtc_printer` module to `tmtccmd.fsfw.tmtc_printer`. Old module references
  new module, old module marked deprecated.
- The `FsfwTmtcPrinter` `get_validity_buffer` function is a `staticmethod` now.

## Fixed

- Bump of `spacepackets`: Bugfix in spacepacket parser which lead to broken packets in the TCP
  communication interface.

# [v5.0.0a0] 2023-05-14

`spacepackets` version: v0.16.0

## Added

- Added FSFW parameter service API to dump parameters.
- Added FSFW parameter service `FsfwParamId` class to uniquely identify a parameter in a
  FSFW context.

## Changed

- The FSFW parameter service helper class `Parameter` is now a composition of the raw parameter data
  and the new `FsfwParamId` class.
- The `create_load_param_cmd` API now expects a `Paramter` instead of raw data.

## Fixed

- Bumped `spacepackets` to v0.16.0 for important bugfix in PDU header format.

# [v4.1.2] 2023-03-18

## Fixed

- `logging` usage for GUI.

# [v4.1.1] 2023-02-23

## Changed

- Improvements for documentation: Added `spacepackets` cross-references.

# [v4.1.0] 2023-02-23

## Added

- Added various parameter helpers in the `pus.s20_fsfw_param` module. This includes
  helper methods to pack signed values (i8, i16 and i32), float/double vectors and matrices
  parameters.

# [v4.0.0] 2023-02-17

Starting from this version, the project will adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https:://semver.org/).
spacepackets version: v0.15.0

## Changed

- Renamed `pus.s5_event` and `pus.s5_event_defs` to `pus.s5_fsfw_event` and
  `pus.s5_fsfw_event_defs` to better reflect this module is FSFW specific.

## Added

- First sat-rs support modules: `pus.s5_satrs_event` and `pus.s5_satrs_event_defs`

## Removed

- `pack_generic_service_5_test_into` removed, not generic enough.

# [v4.0.0rc2] 2023-02-12

## Fixed

- Use custom package discovery in `pyproject.toml` similarly how to discovery
  was handled in `setup.cfg`. Auto-Discovery was problematic, package is not discovered
  correctly.

# [v4.0.0rc1] 2023-02-10

`spacepackets` version 0.14.0

## Fixed

- `config.args`: Assigning of the COM interface in the args to setup converters is now done in
  the `args_to_params_generic` function. Otherwise, this feature does not work for the conversion
  of CFDP arguments. 

## Changed

- Remove `setup.cfg` and move to `pyproject.toml`. Create new `.flake8` file accordingly.

## Added

- `tc.pus_200_fsfw_mode.create_announce_mode_command` added.

# [v4.0.0rc0] 2023-02-03

- `spacepackets` version 0.14.0rc3

## Changed

### Logging

The usage of the `logging` library now is a lot more pythonic and more
aligned to the recommended way to use the logger. The `get_console_logger` has become deprecated.
Users are encouraged to create custom application loggers using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
It is also possible to apply the library log format to an application logger using
`tmtccmd.logging.add_colorlog_console_logger`. 

- Mark `get_console_logger` as deprecated.
- New `tmtccmd.init_logger` method to set up library logger.
- The logging default init function does not set up an error file logger anymore.
- (breaking) Rename `set_up_colorlog_logger` to `add_colorlog_console_logger`.

## Added

- New `add_error_file_logger` function.

# [v4.0.0a3] 2023-01-31

- `spacepackets` version 0.14.0rc2

## Added

- `tmtccmd.com.ComInterface`: Added two new generic exceptions:
  - `ReceptionDecodeError` for generic decoder errors on packet reception.
  - `SendError` for generic send errors when sending packets.
- `tmtccmd.pus.pus_20_fsfw_params_defs`: New `ParameterId` and `Parameter` helper
  dataclasses. Also added `Service20ParamDumpWrapper` helper class
  to help with the deserialization of parameters. The helper classes can be used both
  for TC and TM handling. Create new API set to create the `Parameter` classes for common
  parameter types.
- `SetupParams` can now already include a COM interface instance.
- CLI arguments: Added the `--pp` or `--prompt-proc` argument which only has meaning when used
  together with the listener flag (`-l`). It should cause the main application to prompt for
  a procedure (but still go to listener mode after the procedure).

## Changed

### Argument parsing and Core modules

- (breaking): `tmtccmd.config.hook.TmTcCfgHookBase` renamed to `tmtccmd.config.hook.HookBase`.
- (breaking): The `PostArgsParsingWrapper` constructor now expects a `SetupParams` parameter and
  caches it.
  All `set_*` methods now do not expect the `SetupParams` to be passed explicitely anymore.
- (breaking): The `PreArgsParsingWrapper` now expects a `setup_params` parameter to be passed to the
  `parse` method. The parameter helper will be cached in the created `PostArgsParsingWrapper`. 
- `args_to_params_tmtc` now expects an `assign_com_if` method and can assign a COM interface
  when it is passed. It oftentimes makes sense to determine a valid COM interface
  (and prompt applicable parameters from the user) before prompting procedure parameters.
  The new behaviour is the default when using the `PostArgsParsingWrapper`.

### PUS modules

- (breaking): Renamed `tmtccmd.*.*20_params.py` to
  `tmtccmd.*.*20_fsfw_param.py` to reflect these modules are tailored
  towards usage with the FSFW.
- (breaking): Reworked `tmtccmd.tm.pus_20_fsfw_params` by simplifying `Service20FsfwTm`
  significantly. It only implements `AbstractPusTm` now and is a simple wrapper
  around `PusTelemetry`, which is exposed as a `pus_tm` member.
- (breaking): Renamed `tm.pus_5_event` to `tm.pus_5_fsfw_event` to better reflect these modules
  are tailored towards usage with the FSFW
- (breaking): Simplified `Service5Tm` significantly. It only implements `AbstractPusTm` now and
  is a more simple wrapper around `PusTelemetry` exposing some FSFW specific functionality.
- (breaking): Renamed `tmtccmd.*.*200_fsfw_modes` to `tmtccmd.*.*200_fsfw_mode` and
  `tmtccmd.*.*20_fsfw_params` to `tmtccmd.*.*20_fsfw_param` for consistency.
- `tmtccmd.tc.pus_20_params.py`: Create new `crate_fsfw_load_param_cmd` and
  deprecate the former `pack_fsfw_load_param_cmd` function.

### Other

- (breaking): `DefaultPusQueueHelper`: `seq_cnt_provider`, `pus_verificator`
  and `default_pus_apid` (formerly `pus_apid`) do not have default values anymore
  and need to be specified explicitely. 
- (breaking): Renamed `tmtccmd.config.com.ComIfCfgBase` to `ComCfgBase`
- (breaking): `tmtccmd.com.ComInterface`: Change `get_id` to `id` property.
- (breaking): TCP (`tmtccmd.com.TcpSpacePacketsComIF`) and `tmtccmd.com.UdpComIF`:
   Remove `max_recv_size` argument and replace it with 4096 where it was used.
- (breaking): TCP: Renamed `tmtccmd.com.TcpComIF` to `tmtccmd.com.TcpSpacePacketsComIF` to better
  reflect this interface sends and expects space packets.
- (breaking) TCP: The TCP communication interface now expects a generic `Sequence[PacketId]`
  instead of a tuple of raw packet IDs. This makes usage more ergonomic.
- (possibly breaking): Rename `com_if` module to `com`.
- (breaking): `tmtccmd.tc.queue.DefaultPusQueueHelper`: The timestamp length of time tagged
  telecommands needs to be specified explicitely now (no default value of 4).

## Fixed

- TCP: Actually use the TM polling frequency parameter now in the TM reception thread.
- TCP: The `data_available` API now works properly by always converting the internal unparsed
  TM queue to the TM packet list and returning its length.

# [v4.0.0a2] 2023-01-23

## Added

- Added `apid` and `seq_count` optional arguments back to generic
  (not FSFW specific) TC constructors.
- Cleaned up telecommand and telemetry code, removed a lot of obsolete
  functionality

## Changed

- (breaking) `pus` module: Renamed `pus_?...` modules to `s?_...`. These modules
  now re-export all their definitions and everything in their similarly
  named `tm` and `tc` modules.
- (breaking) `pus.pus_8_funccmd`: Renamed `Subservices` to `CustomSubservice`
- TC creation API: Replace `generate_...` API with `create_...` API for consistency
- (breaking) Renamed `Subservices` to `Subservice`, use singular enum because they are not
  flag enums.
- (breaking) `pus_200_fsfw_mode`: Rename `Modes` to `Mode`.
- Subservice enumerations: Add missing `TM_...` and `TC_...` prefixes where applicable
- Use concrete `spacepackets` version 0.14.0rc1

# [v4.0.0a1] 2023-01-12

## Fixed

- `enable_periodic_hk_command`: Remove third obsolete ssc argument

# [v4.0.0a0] 2023-01-05

## Added

- New `SerialCobsComIF` communication interface to send and received COBS encoded packets.

## Changes

- `CoreComInterfaces`: Renamed `ser_*` interface names to `serial_*`.
- Split up the `SerialComIF` into distinct classes:
  - `SerialFixedFrameComIF`, but this one has also been deprecated now.
  - `SerialDleComIF` for sending and receiving DLE encoded packets.
- Switched to compatible release requirement for dependencies.
- `ComInterface`: Added new abstract method `get_id`, removed `__init__` dunder.
